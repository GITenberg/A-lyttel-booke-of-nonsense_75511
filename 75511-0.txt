To the Reader


Few of the cuts in this book are less than four hundred years old. To
join them to new occasions need be no slur on their value and beauty,
if the rhyme be taken as lightly as it is offered by a lover of old
things as well as new, who is indebted to Messrs. Quaritch, Leighton,
Barnard, and others, for much more than is here to be seen, as also to
Edward Lear.
